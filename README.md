picsorter
=========
picsorter is a quick tool i created to move pictures from my camera's sd card to a destination directory in a standard date-formatted directory structure

For example: ABC.jpg, with a modification date of 5/14/2014 would be categorized into a folder:

     \201405\2014-05-14\ABC.jpg

The application prompts for source directory (with option for recursive search) and destination  directory. The program can optionally DELETE the files from the source directory after categorizing them.
